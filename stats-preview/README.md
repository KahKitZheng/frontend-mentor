## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use `background-blend-mode` property to add a filter on top of an image.

```css
.card__image {
  background-blend-mode: multiply;
  background-color: var(--accent-main);
}
```

### Continued development

- Start with Mobile-first workflow instead of Desktop-first approach.
- Find a naming convention for CSS variables that works for me.
- Explore advanced CSS properties such as `background-blend-mode`.
